# HANGMAN

For this problem, you will implement a variation of the classic wordgame Hangman. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the rules, you may read all about it here. In this problem, the second player will always be the computer, who will be picking a word at random.

In this problem, you will implement a function, called hangman, that will start up and carry out an interactive Hangman game between a player and the computer.


### This was a very large problem with extra files. The course provided helper functions to get going, along with code files and wordlist. These things are not included. Only the solutions I provided.
