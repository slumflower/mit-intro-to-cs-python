Assume `s` is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of `s` in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if `s = 'azcbobobegghakl'`, then your program should print

<pre>Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh </pre>

In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if `s = 'abcbcd'`, then your program should print

<pre>Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc</pre>
